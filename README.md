## 🔧 Improvements Over Original System client Client

**ORIGINAL PROJECT**

https://github.com/DLindustries/System

This fork is approximately **75% based on the original Argon**, but with focused optimizations for **bypassing Vulcan** and reducing flagging on **Grim Anticheat**. It's a graphics and anticheat-optimized version of Argon with the following key changes:

- **Legit Autototem (HoverTotem-Like)**
  - Introduced **dynamic delay** to simulate human-like behavior
  - removed autoswitch due to unstable bypasses from argon

- **Dhandmod integration**
  - basically autoswitch subfunction from hovertotem of argon but without padpackets and impossibleslot action and impossible human time
  - does not flag on any anticheat - for now
  - can choose your totem slot
  - can customize automation timings

- **Misclick Optimizer**
  - Rewritten and extended from Argon's original
  - Prevents **packet order B flags** (Grim)
  - Reduces **Multiactions F flagging**
  - Best paired with **AutoCrystal** and **Anchor Macro**

- **KeyPearl Enhancements**
  - Added **switchback slot selection** for faster **double-tapping** and **pearl flashing**
  - Eliminates **packet order B flagging** from original

- **Placement Optimizer**
  - Allows faster crystal placement pair with autocrystal, removing 2 tick placement delay - bypasses vulcan and grim
  - allows quick block up useful for cpvp
  - Now includes **anchor exclusion** to improve legit like gameplay with Anchor Macro

- **Target HUD Improvements**
  - Sleeker and cleaner design
  - Displays **extra opponent information** for PvP clarity

- **Camera Optimizer**
  - Improved camera control for better PvP experience such as no clip and water+ lava visual optimizers
  - Designed to work well with **Freelook mod**

- **And alot more tiny adjustments**
> ⚠️ Note: This is not a full rewrite — it's still fundamentally Argon, but with meaningful tweaks to **bypass**, **optimize**, and **refine** both visuals and behavior for smoother gameplay under grim anticheat and vulcan.

5. build a suitable configuration for the servers you are targeting to bypass - keep reading read.me for config guide
6. Enjoy System!

> if an issue still coccurs, please send your crash log "latest.log" in my discord server for troubleshooting.





## Configs

**Grim AC** - PvpHub, Donut SMP, and likely any other large Popular servers.

DON'T USE
- Autototem-blatant
- Autocrystal to lower than 2 ticks for both break and place
- Anchor Macro set to super fast - 0 ticks - test on loyisa.cn anticheat test server
- break optimizer
- jump optimizer
- totem offhand

**Bypassable when done correctly. if you are bad at crystal pvp in the first place avoid using these modules**

- Dtapsetup
- anchor spam along with airplacement with anchor macro and airplace optimizer


*YOU MUST*
- auto xp not 0 delay
- misclick optimizer MUST BE ENABLED WITH ALL SUBFUNCTIONS
- placement optimizer MUST EXCLUDE ANCHORS
- Use common sense, most 0 delays flag. Please check using a Anticheat server - eu.loyisa.cn

**Vulcan and other insignificant anticheats** - Eupvp.net, mcprac.net, mcpvp.club, Pvp Legacy, Stray.gg

Most modules bypasses. If you want safety, then:

*Use the same config for Grim AC BUT*

- you can use anchor macro safe and quickly using the DEFAULT settings.
- you can use Dig optimizer  - not recommended but usable
- you can use jump optimizer - not recommended but usable
- you can use dtapsetup

**This is only a guide/general idea. For your own safety, i HIGHLY recommend you test your configs on a anticheat test server. BEFORE playing any of your favourite servers.**
